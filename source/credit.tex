\chapter*{Credit}

Short but hopefully enough since this is being distributed...

\begin{itemize}
	\item Relating to the credit main part goes to Prof.~Dr.~Szech since most of the notes are directly copied from her lecture. 
	\item For notes regarding to certain papers all credit goes to the author of that paper especially since those abstracts has simply been copied out.
	\item Any additions which hasn't been discussed in the lecture but I felt like they are missing in the notes has been either quoted from wikipedia or from Prof.~Puppe's lecture for game theory.
\end{itemize}
