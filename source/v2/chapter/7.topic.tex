			\item The possibility that market interaction may erode moral values is a long-standing, but controversial, hypothesis in the social sciences, ethics, and philosophy. To date, empirical evidence on decay of moral values through market interaction has been scarce. We present controlled experimental evidence on how market interaction changes how human subjects value harm and damage done to third parties. In the experiment, subjects decide between either saving the life of a mouse or receiving money. We compare individual decisions to those made in a bilateral and a multilateral market. In both markets, the willingness to kill the mouse is substantially higher than in individual decisions. Furthermore, in the multilateral market, prices for life deteriorate tremendously. In contrast, for morally neutral consumption choices, differences between institutions are small.

			\item In many cultures and industries gifts are given in order to influence the recipient, often at the expense of a third party. Examples include business gifts of firms and lobbyists. In a series of experiments, we show that, even without incentive or informational effects, small gifts strongly influence the recipient’s behaviour in favour of the gift giver, in particular when a third party bears the cost. Subjects are well aware that the gift is given to influence their behaviour but reciprocate nevertheless. Withholding the gift triggers a strong negative response. These findings are inconsistent with the most prominent models of social preferences. We propose an extension of existing theories to capture the observed behaviour by endogenising the “reference group” to whom social preferences are applied. We also show that disclosure and size limits are not effective in reducing the effect of gifts, consistent with our model. Financial incentives ameliorate the effect of the gift but backfire when available but not provided.

	\item Kerschbamer, R.; Neururer, D.; Sutter, M. (2014): \textit{How Customers' insurance coverage induces sellers' misbehaviour in markets for credence goods}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Markets for credence goods are characterised by informational asymmetries between expert sellers and their customers, which creates strong incentives for fraudulent behaviour of sellers that results in estimated annual costs to customers and the society as a whole of billions of dollars in the US alone. Prime examples of credence goods are all kinds of repair services, the provision of medical treatments, the sale of software programs, and the provision of taxi rides in unfamiliar cities. In this paper, we examine in a natural field experiment how insurance coverage on the side of the consumer – often prevalent on important markets such as the health care or repair services sectors – can seriously exacerbate inefficiencies in the provision of credence goods by inducing misbehaviour on the side of the seller. Specifically, we study how computer repair shops take advantage of customers’ insurance for repair costs. In a control treatment, the average repair price is about Euro 70, with the repair bill increasing to Euro 129 when the service provider is informed that the insurance would reimburse the bill. Our design allows for a decomposing of the sources of this economically impressive and statistically highly significant difference showing that this is mainly due to the over-provision of parts and overcharging of working time. Overall, our results strongly suggest that insurance coverage greatly increases the extent of misbehaviour of sellers in important sectors of the economy with potentially huge costs to customers and whole economies.
