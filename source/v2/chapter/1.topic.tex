\chapter{Standard theoretic basics for analysis of strategic behaviour}

First, a strategic interaction occurs when the utility of actors, e.g. players (individuals, companies, ...) in a situation is mutually influenced by individual behavioural changes. 

A \begriff{game} is a formal representation of a situation in which a number of individuals interact in a setting of \textit{strategic interdependence}.
	We have to clarify four points:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The players: Who is interacting?
		\item When do they move or what can they do?
		\item The outcomes: For each possible set of actions by the players, what is the outcome of the game?
		\item The payoffs: What are the players' preferences over the possible outcomes?
	\end{itemize}

For example Tick-Tack-Toe games, auctions or even meetings can be described with games. 

\index{equilibrium} % todo definituon
In the following two sections equilibria are one of our main focus point. Three properties describe such a state, where economic forces are balanced and in the absence of external influences the behaviour leading to the equilibrium will not change:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The behaviour of agents in such a point is consistent.
	\item No agent has an incentive to change its behaviour.
	\item The equilibrium is the outcome of some dynamic process (stability).
\end{enumerate}

~\newline
Subsequent, we distinguish between the formal representation which we use to model the conflict situation, however all situations we will examine will have complete information.
