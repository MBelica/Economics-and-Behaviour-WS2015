\chapter{Standard theoretic basics for analysis of strategic behaviour}

First, a strategic interaction occurs when the utility of agents in a situation is mutually influenced by individual behavioural changes. 

A \begriff{game} is a formal representation of a situation in which a number of individuals interact in a setting of strategic interdependence.
	It is necessary to clarify four points for a game:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The players: Who is interacting?
		\item The rules: When do they move or what can they do?
		\item The outcomes: For each possible set of actions by the players, what is the outcome of the game?
		\item The payoffs: What are the players' preferences over the possible outcomes?
	\end{itemize}

For example, Tick-Tack-Toe games, auctions or even meetings can be described as games. 

\index{equilibrium}
In the following two sections, equilibria are one of our main focus points. Let us consider a state, where economic forces are balanced, and, in the absence of external influences, the behaviour leading to the equilibrium will not change. Such a state can be described by three properties: \index{equilibrium}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The behaviour of agents in such a point is consistent.
	\item No agent has an incentive to change his behaviour.
	\item The equilibrium is the outcome of some dynamic process (stability).
\end{enumerate}

~\newline
Furthermore, we subsequently study different formal representations which we use to model the conflict situation. However, all situations we will examine will have complete information, i.e. perfect knowledge (esp. structure of the game, possible actions and payoff functions of all players) is available to all individuals.
