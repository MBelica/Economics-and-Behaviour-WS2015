We started with the Dictator-Game, Christoph Engel wrote an interesting book to this topic (Dictator-Games: A meta study (2011)).

\begin{example}[Ultimatum-Game]	\label{ultimatumgame}
The Ultimatum-Game is a dynamic game under complete information. \\
We look at two players in two stages. The first player (the proposer (P)) receives a sum of money $(M = 10)$ and proposes how to divide the sum between himself $(x_{p})$, where $x_{p} \in \{ 0, 1, 2, \dotsc, 10 \}$, and another player $(10 - x_{p})$. The second player (the responder (R)) chooses to either accept or reject this proposal. If the second player accepts, the money is split according to the proposal. If the second player reject, neither player receives any money.

Lets sum this up again:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item P proposes split up $(x_{p}, 10 - x_{p})$
		\item R accepets or rejects
			\begin{itemize}
				\item If R accepts $(a)$, proposal becomes implemented. P receives $x_{p}$ and R $10 - x_{p}$
				\item If R rejects $(r)$, the whole money gets destroyed.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, level 1/.style={sibling distance=35mm/#1}, level distance=25mm ]
			\node [circle,draw] (z){$P$}
 						child {node [circle,draw] (a) {$10$}	}
 						child {node [] (b) {$ $}	}
 						child {node [circle,draw] (c) {$x_{p}$}
  							child {node [circle,draw] (f) {$(x_{p}, 10 - x_{p})$}	}
  			 				child {node [circle,draw] (g) {$(0, 0)$}	}			
 						}
 						child {node [] (d) {$ $}	}
  						child {node [circle,draw] (e) {$0$}
			};
			\path (a) -- (b) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
			\path (b) -- (c) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
			\path (c) -- (d) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
			\path (d) -- (e) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
			\path (f) -- (g) node [midway] {$a / r$};
		\end{tikzpicture}				
	\end{center}
	
	A strategy set in this game would have to look like
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Proposer sets a $x_{p}$
		\item Reciever decides for \textit{any} $x_{p}$ that might come up if he'd accept or reject that offer.
	\end{itemize}
	( strategy needs to specify a complete action plan. )
	
	
	\textbf{1. Question:} Can the outcome $(5, 5)$ be stabilized as a Nash-Equilibrium outcome? \\
	\textbf{Answer:} Yes. Say P proposes $x_{p} = 5$ and the strategy set for R is defined by accepting for any value of $x_{p} \leq 5$ and rejecting the offer for values larger then $5$. \\
		In this situation $(5, 5)$ would be stabilized as a Nash-Equilibirum.


	\textbf{2. Question:} Is there another Nash-Equilibirium that stabelizes the $(5, 5)$ outcome? \\
	\textbf{Answer:} Yes. If P again proposes $x_{p} = 5$ and the strategy set for R is defined by accepting for only $x_{p} = 5$ and rejecting for any other case, so $x_{p} \neq 5$. 
	
	
	\textbf{3. Question:} Can $(0, 10)$ be stabilized as a Nash-Equilibrium? \\
	\textbf{Answer:} Yes. We set the strategy for P as $x_{p} = 0$ and for R demand accepting for $x_{p} = 0$ and rejecting for any other case, meaning for $x_{p} \geq 1$. 
\end{example}

As we can see the Nash-Equilibrium can lead to an infinite amount of outcomes some of them even with implauseble threats. We'd therefore would like to refine this kind of equilibrium which leads to the (subgame) perfect Nash-Equilibrium.

\begin{definition}[Subgame]
	A subgame start at a desicion node. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[(Subgame-)Perfect Nash-Equilibrium]
	How to find a Perfect Nash-Equilibrium:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Define (one set of) optimal actions for the last subgame
		\item Replace that decision nodes with the respective outcome
		\item Repeat $1)$ and $2)$ until the first decision node.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Sequel to the Ultimatum-Game]
	Searching for the Perfect Nash-Equilibrium in this case leads to:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Defining the optimal actions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item In the case $P$ chooses $x_{p} = 10$, then $R$ recieves  $10 - x_{p} = 0$ and he is 	indifferent between refusing and accepting. Let's assume for now he'd accept in this case.
				\item In all other cases, meaning $x_{p} \in [0, 10)$, would R recieve $10 - x_{p} > 0$. Therefore he would accept the offer in all cases.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Now we can reduce the game to the following game tree
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzpicture}[level/.style={sibling distance=25mm/#1}, level 	distance=25mm]
					\node [circle,draw] (z){$P$}
 						child {node [circle,draw] (a) {$(10, 0)$}	}
 						child {node [] (b) {$ $}	}
 						child {node [circle,draw] (c) {$(5, 5)$}	}
 						child {node [] (d) {$ $}	}
  						child {node [circle,draw] (e) {$(0, 10)$}
					};
					\path (a) -- (b) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
					\path (b) -- (c) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
					\path (c) -- (d) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
					\path (d) -- (e) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
				\end{tikzpicture}				
			\end{center}
		\item In the reduced game we have already reached the first node and can now analyze the situation for Nash-Equilibriums. Here $P$ choses $x_{p} = 10$ since it results in his highes utility.
	\end{enumerate}
	$\Rightarrow P$ plays $x_{p} = 10$ together with R always accepts constitutes a Subgame-Perfect Nash-Equilibrium. 

	If we'd look for another equilibrium it yields
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item the optimal actions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Again, in all cases $x_{p} \in [0, 10)$ would R recieve $10 - x_{p} > 0$. Therefore he would accept the offer in all cases.
				\item If he now would refuse to the offer $x_{p} = 10$ it would be plausable therefore subgame perfect, since he indifferent between both choices.
			\end{itemize}
		\item the tree changes only slightly:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzpicture}[level/.style={sibling distance=25mm/#1}, level 	distance=25mm]
					\node [circle,draw] (z){$P$}
 						child {node [circle,draw] (a) {$(0, 0)$}	}
 						child {node [circle,draw] (b) {$(9, 1)$}	}
 						child {node [] (c) {$ $}	}
 						child {node [circle,draw] (d) {$(5, 5)$}	}
 						child {node [] (e) {$ $}	}
  						child {node [circle,draw] (f) {$(0, 10)$}
					};
					\path (b) -- (c) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
					\path (c) -- (d) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
					\path (d) -- (e) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
					\path (e) -- (f) node [midway] {$\cdots$};
				\end{tikzpicture}				
			\end{center}
	\end{enumerate}
	$\Rightarrow P$ plays $x_{p} = 9$ together with R always accepts if $x_{p} < 10$ and refuses for $x_{p} = 10$ constitutes also a Subgame-Perfect Nash-Equilibrium. 
\end{example}
