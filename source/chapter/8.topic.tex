\section{Pleasures of Skill and Moral Conduct}

Background:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Jeremy Bentham points out fourteen different $"$simple$"$ sources of pleasures for humans
	\item In this short list, number three are the $"$pleasure of skill$"$ while number five are $"$the pleasure of a good name$"$.
	\item Yet if being skilful is of crucial importance to people then this can oppose the possibility to keep a good name
\end{itemize}
  
  
  
\textbf{As an example: The Manhattan Project.} After the dropping of the plutonium bomb on Nagasaki, numerous members of the Manhattan Project started worrying about moral implications. Many of the scientists suffered from e.g depressions. \\ 

The Self-Image is so relevant in this concept. Both the desire for mastery and acting in accordance with moral values originate from the same source, a desire for positive self-image. \\ 

The remaining question is therefore: does morality in some (everyday) situations get traded off against skilfulness?


\section{Moral and Markets}

Examples for market designs where the idea of introducing a free market (money based) is current:
\begin{itemize}
	\item trading markets for emission certificates. To reduce pollution by restricting emission output per country a contract was design, which nevertheless allowed trading of those certificates. M. Sandel was concerned that if we put a money value on pollution it might become less moral concerning to pollute.
	\item Allocation of organs markets: one might be able to trade an incompatible organ for an compatible if available. People started discussing if money should not be introduced in this market instead of just a trading market.
	\item Adoption: high income families might be able to provide better for adopted children and therefore could be preferred on an adoption list
	\item In California child baring is allowed to be traded for money 
\end{itemize}

Restricted markets:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Employment markets are regulated, so exploitation is not (so) present.
\end{itemize}



Next, a paper was presented on the topic of \textit{moral and markets} by Prof. Szech. It is linked on ilias but this is roughly the topic:


The possibility that market interactions may erode moral values is a long-standing, but controversial, hypothesis in the social sciences, ethic and philosophy. Markets are accused to transform human values in exchange blues and goods into commodities. It has also been argues that market institutions may influence preferences in general with a tendency to make people.

Michael Sandal analysed that with technological progress and the increasing ubiquity of market ideas, since markets continue to enter further and further domains of our social life.


Further, there is the doux commerce hypothesis, meaning that the entering of market in our social life might improve our situation in many ways...
