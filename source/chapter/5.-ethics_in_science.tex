\section{Pleasures of Skill and Moral Conduct}
Background:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Jeremy Bentham pointed fourteen different $"$simple$"$ sources of pleasures for humans out
	\item In this short list, number three is the $"$pleasure of skill$"$ while number five is $"$the pleasure of a good name$"$.
	\item Yet if being skilful is of crucial importance to people than this can oppose the possibility to keep a good name
\end{itemize}
  
  
  
\textbf{As an example: The Manhattan Project.} After the dropping of the plutonium bomb on Nagasaki, numerous members of the Manhattan Project started worrying about moral implications. Many of the scientists suffered from e.g depressions. \\ 

The Self-Image is so relevant in this concept. Both the desire for mastery and acting in accordance with moral values originate from the same source, a desire for positive self-image. \\ 

The remaining question is therefore: does morality in some (everyday) situations get traded off against skilfulness?

		\begin{itemize}
			\item As was recognised by Bentham, skilfulness is an important source of pleasure. Humans like achievement and to excel in tasks relevant to them. This paper provides controlled experimental evidence that striving for pleasures of skill can have negative moral consequences and causally reduce moral values. In the study, subjects perform an IQ-test. They know that each correctly solved question not only increases test performance but also the likelihood of moral transgression. In terms of self-image, this creates a trade-off between signalling excellence and immoral disposition. We contrast performance in the IQ-test to test scores in an otherwise identical test, which is, however, framed as a simple questionnaire with arguably lower self-relevance. We find that subjects perform significantly better in the IQ-test condition, and thus become more willing to support morally problematic consequences. Willingness to reduce test performance in order to behave more morally is significantly less pronounced in the IQ versus the more neutral context. The findings provide controlled and causal evidence that the desire to succeed in a challenging, self-relevant task has the potential to seduce subjects into immoral behaviours and to significantly decrease values attached to moral outcomes.
